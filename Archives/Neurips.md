## 🧭 Introduction

> *“No understanding of intelligence is complete without understanding time.”*

In the pursuit of artificial intelligence, **space and time** are not just inputs to be modeled — they are the very substrate of reasoning. Among them, **time** is the most elusive: continuous yet discrete, objective yet subjective, simple in form yet profound in implication. Every prediction is a claim about the future. Every model is, implicitly or explicitly, a theory of time.

This repository is an evolving map — an attempt to trace the frontiers of **temporal understanding in AI**. By curating and organizing key works from  
[**ICML**](./Archives/ICML.md), [**ICLR**](./Archives/ICLR.md), and [**NeurIPS**](./Archives/NeurIPS.md) 2025 and beyond, we seek to illuminate the **core principles** of modern time-series learning:  
from scalable forecasting to causal inference, from spatiotemporal attention to dynamic memory.

Our guiding question is simple, yet vast in scope:  
**What does it mean for a machine to understand time?**

Along this journey, we pay special attention to:

- 📈 The elegance in **simple, interpretable temporal models**
- 🌌 The emergence of **spatiotemporal intelligence** from data
- 🧠 The evolving philosophies behind **modeling, abstraction, and causality**

Ultimately, we believe that in **simplicity lies depth** — and in **time lies truth**.
